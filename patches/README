libmemcached is bundled here as a libtool "convenience" library

The reason for doing this is that during the development of moxi, we
found the most expedient path to implementation was to rely on some of
the internals of libmemcached rather than operate through documented API.
Since the libmemcached on the platform you're using may be different,
we chose to bundle it as a statically linked "convenience" library for
safety.

It is the same libmemcached as the upstream, just tested to ensure correct
behavior.  No modifications have been made to the code, only to the
build properties.  All patches are in the "patches" directory.
